<!-- .slide: id="usecase" -->
### USE CASE
==**PHISHCURE**== <br><br>
Phishing site detection involves identifying fraudulent websites designed to steal sensitive information from unsuspecting users. 
The aim is to safeguard users from the harmful consequences of phishing attempts, such as identity theft and financial fraud. 
To detect phishing sites, various Machine Learning algorithms are  been utilized. These algorithms analyze various features extracted from the website, such as URLs, domain age, IP address, protocol, and redirection status , to determine the probability of the link/URL being Phishing or legitimate.

<grid drag="60 30" drop="top" align="center">
### Approach
The steps which we have performed for this AI-powered system are:
</grid>


<grid drag="70 70" drop="15 30"  align="center"> 
![[ml.png]]
</grid>
--
### Data Collection

Gathering data of phishing links from emails, sms, other websites, even legitimate links and extracting features for training the model from the collected links.
![[datacollection.png|600x600]]

--

### Data Preprocessing

In this step, we have cleaned the data for analysis as well as training the model by removing duplicate data.

![[data pre.png|600x600]]

--
### Feature Selection

In this step, we have identified the most relevant features  for training the model for accurately distinguishing between phishing and legitimate links.

![[feature.png|600x600]]

--

### Model Selection and Training
In this step, first we select which algorithms suits best for our data. 

- Classification algorithms are chosen due to the binary nature of the dataset, where values represent phishing (1) and legitimate (0) links.
- These algorithms are well-suited to categorize data into distinct classes based on features   extracted from the URLs.

![[model.png|600x500]]

--

### Best model for this tool

After training the above algorithms, finally based on the accuracy we have selected the Random Forest Classifier algorithm.

![[g1.png|600x600]]

--
### Testing
- New URLs are used to evaluate the model's predictive accuracy, determining whether the system correctly identifies phishing or legitimate websites.

- The performance of the model is assessed based on its ability to accurately classify unseen URLs, providing insights into its real-world effectiveness.

--

### Deployment
-  Choose a suitable deployment environment such as PythonAnywhere for hosting the application.

**Deployed** the trained model for real-time prediction of phishing links ,whether the links are phishing or legitimate
